# how to be creative
- to be a good coder you need to be creative
  - need to learn to go around obstacles and think of completely new solutions
- but how do you choose between different paths if no one has ever done it before? you try to maximize elegance (aka simplicity)
  - always be thinking about how you can simplify and make it clearer
- habits are everything
- creative professionals show up everyday. that's it.
- take ownership
- maximize quality: one day of work for Da Vinci is worth 1000 days for less of an artist
- what does it mean to be a 'creative professional?'
- what separates an amateur from a professional?

## Showing up everyday
“Inspiration is for amateurs — the rest of us just show up and get to work,” Chuck Close
“A self-respecting artist must not fold his hands on the pretext that he is not in the mood,” Tchaikovsky admonished.
“Show up, show up, show up, and after a while the muse shows up, too,” Isabel Allende
