## React Tic-Tac-Toe

## Google Maps JavaScript API + React
We've worked with the Google Maps JavaScript API in the past. It gives us access to two objects: Marker and Map. We can display markers on the map. With React, we can now store an array of Markers in the state. To show multiple markers, we have to iterate through the array and render each marker. Pick your five favorite places to eat and render them onto a Google Map as markers!

## React Connect Four
This is really really challenging! Checking for a winner is the hardest part.
