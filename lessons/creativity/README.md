# how to be creative 
- to be a good coder you need to be creative
  - need to learn to go around obstacles and think of completely new solutions
- but how do you choose between different paths if no one has ever done it before? you try to maximize elegance (aka simplicity)
  - always be thinking about how you can simplify and make it clearer
- habits are everything
- creative professionals show up everyday. that's it.
- take ownership
