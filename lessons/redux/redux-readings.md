# React-Redux Resources & Readings

Read the following two articles:
* [Getting Started With Redux](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/getting-started-with-redux-an-intro)
* [Leveling Up With React: Redux](https://css-tricks.com/learning-react-redux/)

And also start getting familiar with the official Redux documentation. You do not need to read all of it, but at least look it over and start exploring it:
* [Official Documentation](http://redux.js.org/index.html)

Submit AT LEAST one question about Redux. The question can be something you're confused about or something you'd like to learn more about. 

Be specific! The question should both show you did the reading and also be something that you're genuinely wondering about. We will answer questions in class on Tuesday.

Submit your questions here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbuGfoFXL4KsKM_oP6bieSl8QeckD7YRhSsXl6eUgNBnEGPA/viewform
