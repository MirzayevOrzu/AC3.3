# Introduction to Whiteboarding
At some point in the interview process for a programming job, you'll be asked to solve problems that'll demonstrate how you think. These problems could come in a variety of different flavors.
* Timed coding challenge - you're given a problem to solve with a time constraint **(can test code)**
* Skype interview - you're video chatting with someone talking through the problem as you go **(maybe could test code)**
* In-person whiteboarding - you're given a problem, a dry erase marker, and whiteboard **(can't test code)**

## Steps to remember
* Repeat
  - Repeat the question
  - Make sure you understand the problem
  - Ask clarifying questions
* Example
  - Write out test cases to make sure you're on the right track
  - Pick two or three inputs and their corresponding outputs
* Assess
  - Talk through a game plan of how you're going to tackle the problem
* Code
  - Actually start writing out the code
* Test
  - Pick a test case and walk through how the function
* Optimize
  - Talk about time complexity and ways to make the solution more efficient

## Tips
* Listen for hints
* Keep talking
* Take your time - it's not a race 

## Exercise 1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23, because 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 23.
```js 
threeFive(10) // returns 23 
```

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 100.
**Challenge: Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.**
