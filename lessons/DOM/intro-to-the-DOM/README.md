DOM stands for 'Document Object Model.' The DOM basically defines the logical structure of web documents and gives us a way to access and manipulate documents.

Everything in the web page is represented as a 'node' in the DOM. We can access and directly manipulate these nodes in order to change what appears on our web page.

Manipulating the DOM is an example of the power of JavaScript. We can use pure JavaScript to completely change all the HTML and CSS element in a webpage.

Read the following: [Into to the DOM](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp)

Please answer the following questions:
- What is the DOM?
- What do we use the DOM for?
- What is the `document` object (checkout the first paragraph [here](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_document.asp))?
