# Unit 0: Prework

Congratulations on getting accepted to Access Code! Please complete the following two assignments before you start class. When you're done, please send an email with a link to your CodeWars and Codecademy profiles to nate@c4q.nyc by end of the day **Sunday, July 17th**:

###1. Get to level 7 on CodeWars:

CodeWars is a website with a big collection of challenge problems, organized by difficulty and topic. It's an awesome resource for honing your skills and becoming a better developer!

Your goal is to improve from an 8 kyu ranking to 7 kyu ranking. You'll have to answer roughly 8-10 of the problems found in the below "Codewars questions bank" link in order to achieve a 7 kyu ranking (also see below for an explanation of 'kyu' and CodeWars ranking).

To get started [signup for a CodeWars account](https://github.com/C4Q/AC3.1/blob/master/lessons/prework/codewars-signup.md) then [start solving questions](https://github.com/C4Q/AC3.1/blob/master/lessons/prework/codewars-question-bank.md)!

CodeWars ranks questions by different levels (aka 'kyu'). Rankings range from level 8 to level 1, with level 8 (aka '8 kyu') being the easiest, and level 1 (aka '1 kyu') being the hardest. The more questions you answer the more your ranking improves. You'll start out at 8 kyu and as you answer questions your kyu level will gradually go down. 1 kyu is the best (but very difficult to achieve), so the lower your ranking the better!
