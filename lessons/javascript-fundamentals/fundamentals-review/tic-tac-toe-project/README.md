# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Instructions
1) You need a data structure to store the game state - a matrix(an array of arrays) would be good!
2) You need a variable to keep track of whose turn it is.
3) Clicking on a square should perform a few operations
  * Check to see if the square has been clicked
  * If not, render a new symbol onto the grid
  * Update the game state data structure
  * Change the current player
  * Invoke function that checks to see if there is a winner  
4) Display an error if you click a box that's already been clicked
5) Display the winning player or tie
6) Restart game - should clear the grid and reset the game state data structure
  * Don't refresh the page...

### Challenge
Create a computer you can play against that randomly places symbols.

### Second Challenge
With no scaffold, make a matching card game with 16 cards. You click two tiles and if they're the same, they get uncovered. If they're not the same, they revert back to being hidden. Your score will be the number of guesses you take and you win when all tiles are uncovered.
